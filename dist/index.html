This is a fast, non-technical introduction to functional reactive programming in
Javascript.  We start with a quick overview of the idea, look at some
pseudocode, discuss why any of this matters; then we look at some popular
libraries; finally, we implement one ourselves, to really drive the concept
home.

In the process, we'll implement a small project: #whargarbl.

# What is reactive programming?

Reactive programming is about declaring relationships outside of time, not
current values.

Reactive relationships keep their results up to date.



## TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)

*Generally speaking, `reactive` means "things are kept up to date."*

It's what you're used to from Excel.



### No, seriously, what is `reactive`?

In standard imperative and other non-reactive programming, we set variables to
values at any given time.

```javascript
const A = 1, B = 2, Sum = A+B;
console.log(`Old sum: ${Sum}`);

A = 10;
console.log(`New sum: ${Sum}`);
```

1. That first `console.log` should say that `Sum` is `11`.
1. The second `console.log` should still say that `Sum` is `11`, because the
   addition was done at a specific time, before the change happened.
1. *In languages with a `reactive` notation*, like in spreadsheets, `Sum` would
   change to `21` in the second `console.log`.

That is, in `reactive` languages, *what `Sum` expresses is addition of `A` and
`B` as a continuing relationship*, not the immediate result value.

Many of the features of programming languages aim to remove burden from
programmers, such as manual memory management, loop control, or socket handling.

Reactive programming aims to allow programmers to remove updating related values
from their workload.


## Spreadsheet example

Spreadsheets have come up often already; let's make a direct example.
Spreadsheets are, essentially, reactive programming systems.  For example, in
Excel, this would be written as

|     | A             | B        |
|:---:|:------------- |:-------- |
| 1   | `5`           | JS "A"   |
| 2   | `6`           | JS "B"   |
| 3   | `=SUM(A1,A2)` | JS "Sum" |

This should render with `11` in `A3`.  If you then change the value in `A1` to
`15`, in response `A3` should change to `21` on its own - without prompting.

This is simple `reactive` programming.

Our goal in this tutorial is to understand programming in this fashion, and then
to implement a practical such system in Javascript.



## Relationships vs values; time

Reactive programming is a fair shift in mindset.  One useful early way to look
at it as "binding relationships, instead of values."

Think about CSS for a moment.  Many of its values are ratios (percentages in
columns and tables, particularly.)  Computed values are explicitly functions
that get kept up to date.  Transitions and animations are relationships
described by labels that are kept up to date through a time process for you.

Reactive programming is, in one sense, programming independent of time.  If I
can say that a value bears this relationship to these other values, and then
trust that the relationships are maintained, then I don't need to worry whether
a given value is up to date, or implement keeping it so.

A large proportion of many programs has to do with updating, maintaining, and
propogating values throughout the app.  Having this supported underneath means
less work in management, and removes a bunch of opportunities for error.



## What is `functional reactive programming` ?

We're not going to cover FRP here, but, the short version is, if you're going
to the extent that a `Haskell`, `OCaml`, or `LISP` person would, and nailing
your RP system down with math, then you're probably doing one of the forms of
FRP.  Arrows-based FRP is an example, if you want to go Googling, but for now,
let's just keep it friendly and simple.

Mostly this topic is here to clarify that no, we are not going to that level of
strictness in our system.



## What we'll do

This tutorial will give a quick overview of Reactive solutions already out there
for Javascript, then dive into a direct, simple implementation of Reactive
programming in JS.  It's much easier to understand Reactive after one has gotten
one's hands dirty in building a system directly.

After that, we'll move ahead to make a project with our Reactive system, to see
how it feels in practice.




<br/><br/><br/><br/>




# Popular JS `reactive` libraries

To be clear, if you're going to use this stuff in production, you're much better
off with a well established `reactive` library with a long history, battle
scars, and an active community.  We're just building one from scratch because
that's how one learns these best.



## Well established libraries

Generally I would advocate one of three libraries in the JS world.



### Bacon.js

Bacon arguably popularised RP in the Javascript world.  Bacon has a very
strictly defined order of events, meaning that even strange edge cases are
handled in a very well defined (although frequently hard to suss out) fashion.
If you're a bank, use Bacon.



### Kefir.js

Kefir is less uptight.  Bacon pays a price in speed for its strictness; Kefir
is what you'll want to use for less agonizingly strict work.  It also has a
rather nicer API, in my opinion.



### Reactivex

Reactivex' biggest advantage is that it's been implemented in more than a dozen
languages.  You can rely of Reactivex to be present not only in today's backend,
but if it's not hipster nonsense, most likely in tomorrow's as well.  If you're
trying to use reactive in complex service situations, this is oftentimes an
absolute necessity, and Reactivex then becomes the only game in town.



## Summary

As you can see from even this brief glimpse, there are tradeoffs to be had in
your choice of implementation.  There are a dozen other serious candidates at
the time of writing; take the time to do some investigation before you choose.

Either way, it's time to get on to the meat of the project: implementing our
own.




<br/><br/><br/><br/>




# Building a modest one ourselves

A person often won't understand a thing until they've hacked one together.
Let's do a low-quality `reactive` system.  We won't put much effort in; as a
result it will be slow, vulnerable to injection attack, and very easy to kill
with cycles.

On the bright side, it'll be easy, and then `reactive` should be clearer.

Let's toss something together.



## Getting Started

To begin with, let's put three other Github repos on your radar:

1. Each major step in the tutorial process has a step in the
   [JRV Tutorial](https://github.com/StoneCypher/jrv_tutorial/) repo.
1. The current final up to date version is
   [distributed on NPM as `jrv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jrv), from a
   [Github repo named `jrv`](https://github.com/StoneCypher/jrv).

With that out of the way, it's time to take steps through the process.  ðŸ˜†



### The plan (ish)

We're going to start by implementing this in *just an* ***awful*** way,
initially.  Then, piece by piece, we'll refine it into something quite usable.

1. Initially, the system will calculate the entire chain every time it's asked,
   with relationships unchangeable after created.
1. In the second step, we'll make relationships changeable.
1. Next, we'll teach the values to update themselves when things change, and
   to cache the values we receive, for better performance.
1. Afterwards, we'll trim the propogations back to only what's actually needed
   ("lazy updates,") and set up the dirty flag system that makes that possible.
1. Next, we'll create "handlers" - routines that are called as values change.
   After this step, the library will become genuinely useful.
1. Following that, we'll support "chain" or "fluent" notation, like one expects
   from `d3` and `jquery`, which will lead to a much more pleasant API.

Let's get started, shall we?



### Building a rig

`TODO COMEBACK this should be and refer to a github page`

We can avoid almost the entirety of building a rig, this time around.  The
[tutorial repo](https://github.com/StoneCypher/jrv_tutorial/) has a series of
HTML files, for each step in the implementation.  These HTML files load the
library, and then you can just work with the library in your browser console of
choice (better instructions in each [HTML file](#todo_comeback))



## Milestones

So, let's start walking through the aforementioned milestones, one by one.



### Step 1 - Can read const `reactive`ly

To begin with, let's go for the genuinely horrid implementation we discussed.
We start there because it's rock stupid simple.

Smart, well written, efficient reactive systems tend to be either subscription
or broadcast models, which propagate changes as they happen.

We're not starting with a smart, well written, efficient system.  We're starting
with modest tools.

Because this is `Built On Works` &trade; technology, we're taking the slow-mode
route and doing the entire computation exhaustively on every request (which is
easier to implement, but extremely wasteful.)

It's a start.  We'll do better quickly.



#### What do we need?

A garbage implementation can be made on a single class, with a constructor and
a custom `getter`.

#### Let's do it

```javascript
class JRV { // js reactive variable

    constructor(comp) { this.comp = comp; }
    get v()           { return this.comp() }

}
```

This is "barely counts" reactive.  Fundamentally, this is the rudimentary sole
piece of `reactive`: having a computation that's always up to date on request.
(It's just that this is awful slow, and can't be updated, and doesn't have any
of the API we'd want from a nice implementation.)

All this really does is take a function in the constructor, then offer a
`getter` which runs the function when gotten.  The `getter`, `.v`, represents
the "value" of the `JRV`, and with time will have more complex behavior.

But, for now, this is pretty much just a lame wrapper of a provided function.



#### Results

> As a quick reminder, a function that adds `A` and `B` and returns the result
> can be expressed briefly in JavaScript as an arrow by writing
>
> ```javascript
> () => A+B
> ```


This isn't exactly elegant, but it gets the job done, per our earlier example:

```javascript
var A   = 5,
    B   = 6,
    Sum = new RN( () => A+B );

console.log( Sum.v );  // 11

A = 15;

console.log( Sum.v );  // 21
```



#### Current code

The full implementation now looks like

```javascript
class JRV { // js reactive variable

    constructor(comp) { this.comp = comp; }
    get v()           { return this.comp() }

}
```

There's a [playground here](#todo_comeback_whargarbl) if you'd like to
experiment before continuing.



#### Problem

This is technically `reactive`, though it is not yet "there" in spirit.  But,
one step at a time, especially during the learning process.  We'll get there
in this document.

![](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/909/991/48c.jpg)

Note that this doesn't do the thing that most people expect from `reactive`
systems, yet - it doesn't actually "react" to changes.  It just has updates in
place at all times.  But the "react" part is the part people want, and where the
name comes from.

It's coming up.

The first thing we should fix is making the value computation updatable.



### Step 2 - Mutable JRV

It's important to be able to change the value of a JRV.  Currently, we cannot.

#### What do we need?

To do this, we'll need to add a `setter` to complement the `getter` for `.v`.

#### Let's do it

```javascript
class JRV {

    constructor(comp) { this.comp = comp; }
    set v(newComp)    { this.comp = newComp; }

    get v() { return this.comp(); }

}
```



#### Results

Not a huge or shocking change here, since we're early on.  We use the same
example, but now we change some underlying computations and show that the change
took, as well.

We're going to implement all the variables as `JRV`s this time, so that we have
something to change, and something derived from them to call.

```javascript
var A = new JRV( () => 0 ),
    B = new JRV( () => 5 ),
    X = new JRV( () => A.v + B.v );

console.log( X.v );

A.v = () => 10; console.log( X.v );
A.v = () => 20; console.log( X.v );
A.v = () => 30; console.log( X.v );

X.v = () => (A.v*2) + (B.v*2);
console.log( X.v );
```

And, that works.  But, honestly, it'd be nice if we didn't have to write arrows
to return simple values, like in A and B there; we should be able to just have
constants there.  We can't, currently, because the `getter` assumes that the
thing in `.comp` storage is a function, and can be called.  So, if you pass an
integer to the `constructor`, the `JRV` will try to call the integer - say,

```javascript
5();
```

... which is nonsense.  The shell will see it this way:

```javascript
> var X = new RN( () => 42 );
undefined

> X.v;
42

> X.v = 10;
10

> X.v;
VM198:5 Uncaught TypeError: this.comp is not a function(â€¦)
get v @ VM198:5(anonymous function) @ VM278:1

> X.v = () => 10;
() => 10

> X.v;
10
```

So, let's make the thing more convenient to use.

There are a bunch of possible responses to this: make two setters, one for
values; test the type on the way in and wrap it with a reader if it's not a
function; check if the thing is a value on emit, and emit safely if not.  There
are ups and downs to each.

The easiest way is to check, in the getter, whether the thing in `.comp` is a
function; if so to call it; if not, to return it directly.

So, we'll change

```javascript
    get v() { return this.comp(); }
```

To

```javascript
    get v() {
        var isFunc = (typeof this.comp === 'function');
        return isFunc? this.comp() : this.comp;
    }
```

As a result, we can now write

```javascript
var A = new JRV(0),
    B = new JRV(5),
    X = new JRV( () => A.v + B.v );

console.log( X.v );

A.v = 10; console.log( X.v );
A.v = 20; console.log( X.v );
A.v = 30; console.log( X.v );

X.v = () => (A.v*2) + (B.v*2);
console.log( X.v );
```

And that's rather nicer.



#### Current code

The full implementation now looks like

```javascript
class JRV {

    constructor(comp) { this.comp = comp; }
    set v(newComp)    { this.comp = newComp; }

    get v() {
        var isFunc = (typeof this.comp === 'function');
        return isFunc? this.comp() : this.comp;
    }

}
```

There's a [playground here](#todo_comeback_whargarbl) if you'd like to
experiment before continuing.



#### Problem

At this point, we have an adequate notation.  However, this approach is very
slow.

Consider the case of a system where `F` depends on `E`, which depends on `D`,
and so on back to `A`.

In our current system, if we make a change to `D` then inspect `F`, every
computation back to `A` will be repeated, wastefully.

Let's fix that, with propagation and caching.



### Step 3 - Values propagate and cache

So for efficiency's sake, let's have the values cache.  To do that, we'll also
need the values to update themselves (because if they cached without updating)
themselves, they'd just be out of date all the time, and then what's the point?



#### What do we need?

Getting values to cache means storing the last value we've seen from them, and
reporting that from the getter, instead of executing directly.

This also means that `JRV`s need to know what depends on them, so that they can
notify the dependencies of a change.

To do that, we'll build a `notifier factory` to make `notifier`s for the
dependant, and we'll make a method on the dependency called `.should_notify`
that tells it to call the `notifier` that we pass to it.

One significant consequence of this approach is that ***`JRV`s must now rely on
other `JRV`s***, because normal variables don't know to call notifiers when
they're set.

(You could alter the `__prototype__` of the primitive types to change that, but
that'd be awful, and would trigger all kinds of security and practical problems,
so, don't.)



#### Let's do it

We start by adding a method `.update`, which can update an internally stored
value to its new state.

```javascript
update() {
    var isFunc        = (typeof this.comp === 'function');
    return this.value = (isFunc? this.comp() : this.comp);
}
```

This is roughly the same as the previous `getter`: check if the stored
computation is a `function`; assign to `value` either the function, called,
or the non-function; return what was assigned.  In this way, `.value` becomes
our value cache.

Following that, the `getter` is reduced to the much simpler returning of the
cached value:

```javascript
get v() {
    return this.value;
}
```

Next, we need to make the `notifier factory`.  This turns out to be quite
straightforward: it's just a `function` that returns another `function` that
we make on the spot, which just calls `.update` on this `JRV`.  We will call
what we return `notifier`s, which is not a technical term, but helps clarify
what's being done.

```javascript
make_notifier() {
    return (() => this.update());
}
```

To use this, the dependency will need to be made aware of the notifier.  We can
set that up with `.should_notify`, a method we can pass the notifier to.

```javascript
    should_notify(cb) {
        this.callbacks = this.callbacks.concat(cb);
    }
```

Looks like we're just going to push it onto the back of an array called
`this.callbacks`.  Of course, `this.callbacks` doesn't exist yet, so, let's
make sure to init that in the `JRV`'s constructor, to an empty array:

```javascript
    constructor(comp) {
        this.comp      = comp;
        this.callbacks = [];
        this.update();
    }
```

As you can see, we also added an `.update()` at the end of the constructor, to
make sure that the `JRV` was entirely up to date once set up.

Finally, we should modify the `setter` to make an `.update` call and then notify
the dependencies manually:

```javascript
    set v(newComp) {
        this.comp = newComp;
        this.update();
        this.callbacks.map(cb => cb());
    }
```



#### Results

Now we have `JRV`s which actively update themselves, and cache their values,
eliminating one large source of inefficiency: wasted recalculation.

```javascript
var A   = new JRV(0),
    B   = new JRV(5),
    Sum = new JRV( () => A.v + B.v );

A.should_notify(Sum.make_notifier());
B.should_notify(Sum.make_notifier());

console.log( Sum.v );

A.v = 10; console.log( Sum.v );
A.v = 20; console.log( Sum.v );
A.v = 30; console.log( Sum.v );

Sum.v = () => (A.v*2) + (B.v*2);
console.log( Sum.v );
```

That's kinda gross, though, that `.should_notify` bit.  Any large extensive use
of this library, that'd get out of control, fast, especially for computations
with a bunch of dependencies.

Most problematically, it puts the conceptual burden of the dependency on the
sources, instead of on the conclusion.  This means that one has to go manually
handle every single dependency one at a time, instead of just giving a list of
what's upstream of the thing you're thinking about at the time.  Not only is
that cumbersome and error-prone, but you also need to do it inline, breaking the
conceptual flow of your computation with a bunch of manual chaff.

We can make a method `.needs` to fix the problem.

All `.needs` will do is accept an array of the `JRV`s that are upstream, and
walk their `.should_notify` methods with our caller's `notifier`.  (For
convenience it'll also accept a non-array single upstream parent.)

```javascript
needs(Dep) {
    if (Array.isArray(Dep)) { Dep.map(d => d.should_notify(this.make_notifier())); }
    else                    { Dep.should_notify(this.make_notifier()); }
    return this;
}
```

As a result, instead of writing

```javascript
var Sum = new JRV( () => A.v + B.v );

A.should_notify(Sum.make_notifier());
B.should_notify(Sum.make_notifier());
```

We may now write

```javascript
var Sum = new JRV( () => A.v + B.v ).needs([A,B]);
```

Which leads to a much more pleasant and readable authoring experience:

```javascript
var A = new JRV(0),
    B = new JRV(5),
    X = new JRV( () => A.v + B.v ).needs([A,B]);

console.log( X.v );

A.v = 10; console.log( X.v );
A.v = 20; console.log( X.v );
A.v = 30; console.log( X.v );

X.v = () => (A.v*2) + (B.v*2);
console.log( X.v );
```

#### Current code

The full implementation now looks like

```javascript
class JRV { // reactive node

    constructor(comp) {
        this.comp      = comp;
        this.callbacks = [];
        this.update();
    }

    should_notify(cb) {
        this.callbacks = this.callbacks.concat(cb);
    }

    needs(Dep) {
        if (Array.isArray(Dep)) { Dep.map(d => d.should_notify(this.make_notifier())); }
        else                    { Dep.should_notify(this.make_notifier()); }
        return this;
    }

    make_notifier() {
        return (() => this.update());
    }

    set v(newComp) {
        this.comp = newComp;
        this.update();
        this.callbacks.map(cb => cb());
    }

    get v() {
        return this.value;
    }

    update() {
        var isFunc        = (typeof this.comp === 'function');
        return this.value = (isFunc? this.comp() : this.comp);
    }

}
```

There's a [playground here](#todo_comeback_whargarbl) if you'd like to
experiment before continuing.



#### Problem

The nice part of `reactive` programming is having your variables just trigger
their own behaviors after they're changed.  We don't have that yet, but, let's
see what happens when we do.

In particular, all that `console.log`ging in the example is pretty grimy, no?

Fix it time.



### Step 4 - Values have handlers

We'd like for variables to have associated behaviors by which to "react" to
changes, thereby earning the conceptual (if not the definitive) part of the
name.

Those behaviors will be functions, which we'll call `change handler`s.



#### What do we need?

We just need to associate a `change handler`, and call it at the right times.



#### Let's do it

First, let's add a method that lets us change the `change handler` on an
existing `JRV`.

```javascript
onchange(newOnChange) {
    this.change_handler = newOnChange;
    return this;
}
```

Next, let's initialize that member in the `constructor`, and take it from a
`constructor` argument we'll add.  We'll also give it a default of a function
that does nothing but return `true`, so that we don't have to go find out if
there's something to call.

```javascript
    constructor(comp = (() => true), onchange = (() => true)) {
        this.comp           = comp;
        this.change_handler = onchange;
        this.callbacks      = [];
        this.update();
    }
```

Finally, we improve `.update` to the following algorithm:

1. Locally store the old cache
1. Update the cache
1. If the updated cache is different than the local store,
  1. Call the `change handler`.

Aaaaand, that can be implemented like this:

```javascript
update() {

    var isFunc   = (typeof this.comp === 'function'),
        oldValue = this.value;

    this.value = (isFunc? this.comp() : this.comp);

    if (this.value !== oldValue) {
        this.change_handler(this.value, oldValue);
    }

    return this.value;

}
```



#### Results

We can now just associate the `console.log` as the behavior of `Sum` when it
changes.  This creates a *far* cleaner example:

```javascript
var logger = NewData => console.log(`Changed: ${NewData}`),

    A      = new JRV(0),
    B      = new JRV(5),

    Sum    = new JRV( () => A.v + B.v )
                   .needs([A,B])
                   .onchange(logger);

console.log( `Initial value: ${Sum.v}` );

A.v = 10;
A.v = 20;
A.v = 30;

Sum.v = () => (A.v*2) + (B.v*2);
```

Now, you will see an initial value, and a bunch of "Changed:" notices, without
their being called for.  The output in a Chrome console should read

<pre>
Initial value: 5         VM102:10
Changed: 15              VM102:1
Changed: 25              VM102:1
Changed: 35              VM102:1
Changed: 70              VM102:1
</pre>

The ***real*** value of `reactive` programming is beginning to deliver.



#### Current code

The full implementation now looks like

```javascript

class JRV { // reactive node

    constructor(comp = (() => true), onchange = (() => true)) {
        this.comp           = comp;
        this.change_handler = onchange;
        this.callbacks      = [];
        this.update();
    }

    should_notify(cb) {
        this.callbacks = this.callbacks.concat(cb);
    }

    needs(Dep) {
        if (Array.isArray(Dep)) { Dep.map(d => d.should_notify(this.make_notifier())); }
        else                    { Dep.should_notify(this.make_notifier()); }
        return this;
    }

    make_notifier() {
        return (() => this.update());
    }

    onchange(newOnChange) {
        this.change_handler = newOnChange;
        return this;
    }

    set v(newComp) {
        this.comp = newComp;
        this.update();
        this.callbacks.map(cb => cb());
    }

    get v() {
        return this.value;
    }

    update() {

        var isFunc   = (typeof this.comp === 'function'),
            oldValue = this.value;

        this.value = (isFunc? this.comp() : this.comp);

        if (this.value !== oldValue) {
            this.change_handler(this.value, oldValue);
        }

        return this.value;

    }

}
```

experiment before continuing.

#### Problem

Consider again the same case of a system where `F` depends on `E`, which depends
on `D`, and so on back to `A`.

This time, suppose that `E`, `F`, and `G` are generally unused except initially.
We're mostly interested in `D`.  (We've attached a handler to `D` so the handler
always needs to be current, we'll say.)

If we change `A`, then we care that `D` gets re-cached. Unfortunately, we also
keep eagerly updating `E`, `F`, and `G`, which (if we aren't using them) is
another (probably lesser) form of waste.

Let's kill that waste too, by implementing lazy updates.




### Step 5 - Dirty flag for lazy recalc

So, now we just want to update the stuff that actually needs to be updated.



#### What do we need?

We need to know which things *actually need* to be updated, and we need to
update those immediately.  For the rest, we just want to mark that the cache
is out of date, then move on.

In our current system, something "needs" to be kept up to date if it has a
handler on it.  Otherwise, it can calc back to the last known cache, on call,
updating everything in its wake.

We would also like to skip this entirly if there's no reason to believe the
current cache is out of date.  That's hard if the system is no longer eagerly
forward-pushing values, though.

The way we'll accomplish this is to change what the `notifier` does.  In the
older versions of `JRV`, when a variable was notified of a change, it would
immediately call `.update`, summoning the new value.

In new `JRV`, the `notifier` will instead call a function that flags the `JRV`
as needing an update (which we call "flagging it `dirty`,") and let the `JRV`
proceed.



#### Let's do it

Initially, a `JRV` should be `dirty`, reflecting that it needs update (we have
been updating from start all along, so this is just the natural new modelling.)
As such we add to the constructor

```javascript
this.dirty = true;
```

Next, we'll need a mechanism to flag a `JRV` as `dirty`.

What this mechanism will do is to set a local flag member called `.dirty` to
`true`, then to call `.update` immediately if the `JRV` has a `change handler`
(because those need immediate update,) then finally to dirty all downstream
dependencies.

```javascript
flag_dirty() {
    this.dirty = true;
    if (this.change_handler) { this.update(); }
    this.callbacks.map(cb => cb());
    return this;
}
```

Now that we have `JRV`s that are born `dirty` and can be made `dirty`, we also
need a way to un`dirty` them.  This will happen in our newer, beefier `.update`:

```javascript
update() {

    var compIsFunc = (typeof this.comp  === 'function'),
        valIsObj   = (typeof this.value === 'object'),
        oldVal     = valIsObj? NaN : this.value;

    this.dirty = false;

    this.value = (compIsFunc? this.comp() : this.comp);

    if (this.value !== oldVal) {
        this.change_handler(this.value, oldVal);
    }

    return this.value;

}
```

We've added a line `this.dirty = false` to suggest that after that line in an
`.update`, the `JRV` is no longer dirty.  However, if you're paying attention,
you'll notice we've also replaced the old-value comparison with something weird
and gross that involves the Not-a-Number `NaN`.  (Guh?)

We're exploiting some grossness in Javascript to get around an unmentioned bug
in version four.

See, in version four, where we assign the current `this.value` to `oldVal`,
if `this.value` was an object, what we'd do would be to make both those names
point at the same object, rather than to get a clone of that object (because
Javascript is gross.)

Now, we could write a deep clone algorithm (because Javascript doesn't have one,
because Javascript is gross,) and also a deep compare algorithm (because... ,)
and *also* take the time to make some difficult choices about what happens when
there's certain complex cases inside, like websockets, or badly written objects
that don't make copy construction possible.

Oooooor.  We could just say "if it's an object, fail the match and issue a
change."  Which is what we'll do here, because, bleh, let's just get on with it.

We could rewrite the path to say "if it's an object, recalc and change;
otherwise cache, recalc, compare, and maybe change."  But that's complicated
and brittle.

Instead we'll exploit a very gross choice in Javascript: `NaN === NaN` is
`false`, not `true` like common sense dictates.

That means that if we use `NaN` as our placeholder, then nothing the comparator
can return will strict-compare true, and therefore we can keep the old algorithm
by dint of Javascript dark magic.

So now that we have a complete dirty flagging system, we can change the
`notifier factory` to return the `dirty flag`ger, instead of the `update`r.

```javascript
make_notifier() {
    return (() => this.flag_dirty());
}
```

And we're done.



#### Results

We now have a `JRV` implementation that caches results, automatically pushes
values exactly as far as they need to go, and keeps dirty flagging all the way
out the tree.

Using the browser debugger, we can witness the dirty flagging and caching
in action:

```javascript
var log        = data => console.log(`Active leaf received: ${data}`),

    Root        = new JRV(0),
    Middle      = new JRV( () => Root.v   * 2 ).needs(Root),
    ActiveLeaf  = new JRV( () => Middle.v * 3 ).needs(Middle).onchange(log),
    PassiveLeaf = new JRV( () => Middle.v * 3 ).needs(Middle);

Root.v = 1;
```

`ActiveLeaf` will log as expected.  On looking in the browser's debugger, one
will see that `PassiveLeaf` is flagged `dirty`, and has an out of date
`cache value` on record.  Hurrah!

#### Current code

The full implementation now looks like

```javascript
```

There's a [playground here](#todo_comeback_whargarbl) if you'd like to
experiment before continuing.

#### Problem

One problem we'll ignore for the moment: the `.onchange` handler is being called
on `ActiveLeaf` *twice*, which is either a subtle bug, or something the user
should be expected to handle, depending on how you look at it.  We'll look at
that later.

For now, the API could use some work.  You can construct a value in place, you
can assign a value in place, but you can't fluent-call a value in place, which
prevents you from doing everything in fluent, if you want to.  Same observation
holds for the change handler.  Let's go full fluent (while also supporting our
entire current interface.)

  4. Paradigms




## Paradigms

We occasionally discuss "paradigms" of programming.

![](https://i.imgflip.com/16yfmw.jpg)

A paradigm is, in broad strokes, a way of looking at authoring software.

Object oriented, functional, logical, constraint based (like SQL and CSS,) and
dozens of others are paradigms of programming.  Many languages, like C++ and
Javascript, support multiple programming paradigms.

When one discusses paradigms, one discusses entirely different worldviews of
how software is made.  By example, imperative software (BCPL / C family) tends
to be small algorithms as functions, built up into successively larger
functions, generally largely heirarchally.  Contrasting, object oriented
software tends to be built in mostly-discrete pieces, separated by interfaces.
Constraint based software tends to be "under these circumstances, fulfill these
requirements, or list for me the possibilities."

Paradigms are inherently sort of a blurry concept, and people often get into
arguments about whether this one or that one "really counts."
