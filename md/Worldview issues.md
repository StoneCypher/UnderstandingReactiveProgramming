## Paradigms

We occasionally discuss "paradigms" of programming.

A paradigm is, in broad strokes, a way of looking at authoring software.

Object oriented, functional, logical, constraint based (like SQL and CSS,) and
dozens of others are paradigms of programming.  Many languages, like C++ and
Javascript, support multiple programming paradigms.

When one discusses paradigms, one discusses entirely different worldviews of
how software is made.  By example, imperative software (BCPL / C family) tends
to be small algorithms as functions, built up into successively larger
functions, generally largely heirarchally.  Contrasting, object oriented
software tends to be built in mostly-discrete pieces, separated by interfaces.
Constraint based software tends to be "under these circumstances, fulfill these
requirements, or list for me the possibilities."

Paradigms are inherently sort of a blurry concept, and people often get into
arguments about whether this one or that one "really counts."
