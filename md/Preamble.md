# Introduction to Reactive Programming

This is a fast, non-technical introduction to functional reactive programming in
Javascript.  We start with a quick overview of the idea, look at some
pseudocode, discuss why any of this matters; then we look at some popular
libraries; finally, we implement one ourselves, to really drive the concept
home.

In the process, we'll implement a small project: #whargarbl.

Buckle up: this is a fun ride.
